## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

This course will cover 4 different types of tests:

* **Unit tests**: Focus on isolating and testing individual smart contract functions or functionalities.
* **Integration tests**: Verify how a smart contract interacts with other contracts or external systems.
* **Forking tests**: Forking refers to creating a copy of a blockchain state at a specific point in time. This copy, called a fork, is then used to run tests in a simulated environment.
* **Staging tests**: Execute tests against a deployed smart contract on a staging environment before mainnet deployment.
